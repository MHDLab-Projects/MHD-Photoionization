# Uncertainty notes

## definitions 

* (measureable) quantity
    * e.g. length
* value
    *  1.01 cm
* true value -  perfect measurement
* measurement - set of operation to determine the value of a quantity
* ...
* measurand - particular quantity subject to measurement
    * e.g. vapor pressure
* influence quantity - not measurand but affects the result
    * e.g. Temp in lenght measurmeent, freq. in potential measurement
* result - value attributed to measurand, obtained by measurement
* uncorrected result - before correction of systematic error
* accuracy- closeness between result and true value
    * not 'precision'
* repeatability - closeness between results of sucessive measurements with same conditions
* reproducibility - closeness between results of successive measurements with different conditions
    * e.g. different observer, measurement method, ... 


* standard deviation:
