# Figure panels 

Directory for final dataset and figures in paper. The intention is cleaned up scripts outputting datasets that are then used to create select image files without exploratory analysis, like in `analysis` folder. Note that figures used in paper and SI may still be produced in other folders.  

* dataset - scripts to generate final dataset including analysis (fitting/processing/etc.) used to generate final figures
* figure_panels - scripts to produce plots from final dataset. 
* figures - svg files that layout figure panels into final figures
* analysis - analysis of final dataset (extra figures). migrating from experiment/analysis
