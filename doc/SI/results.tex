\section{Supplemental Results}

\subsection{Equivalence Ratio Dependence}

On 2023-05-24, we performed measurements with a varying equivalence ratio. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item 516 - a position sweep at a fixed equivalence ratio of 0.6.
    \item 5x3\_pos - a position and equivalence ratio sweep at five equivalence ratios and 0.1\% potassium mass fraction. The lower potassium mass fraction allowed for longer times on each test case allowed for both AES $n_{K}$ and MWT measurements. 
    \item 5x6\_pos - a position and equivalence ratio sweep at five equivalence ratios and 1\% potassium mass fraction. The high potassium mass uses up seed quickly, leaving enough time for only MWT measurements. 
\end{itemize}
 
\subsubsection{5x3 and 5x6 Position-Dependence Test Case Sequences}

This section contains additional measurements for the 5x3\_pos and 5x6\_pos test case sequences. These were two-dimensional parameter sweeps of both stage position and equivalence ratio. See Figure \ref{fig:SI_expt_overview_2023-05-24} for how the sequence was performed. 

Figure \ref{fig:SI_5x3_pos_nK_m3} shows the AES measurements for the 5x3\_pos test case sequence. Note the calibration of the AES signal for this test case sequence exhibited significant calibration drift (see Figure \ref{fig:SI_5x3_pos_alpha}), and systematic error may be present in the $nK$ values.

\subsubsection{516 Position-Dependence Test Case Sequence}

This section contains additional measurements for the 516\_pos test case sequence. This test case sequence was a position sweep at fixed nominal equivalence ratio 0.6. The higher seed rate and longer time on each test case allows for more accurate determination of AS exponential time constants than 5x3\_pos and 5x6\_pos test case sequences. The AES measurements associated with this test case sequence are presented in the main text Figure 3C. 

Figure \ref{fig:SI_536_516_pos_mwt_fitting} shows position-dependent MWT measurements for the 516\_pos and 536\_pos (presented in main text) test case sequences. Figure \ref{fig:SI_tau_cfd_pos_phi_compare} shows the position-dependent CFD-predicted electron lifetimes for K+ and O2\_A for both the 516 and 536 test case sequences. 

In Figure \ref{fig:SI_536_516_pos_mwt_fitting}B, position-dependent SFR is shown. For phi = 0.59, the SFR is maximized at 155 mm downstream (compared to 180 mm for phi=0.79). We therefore compare lifetime measurements for 0.59 equivalence ratio with positions 25 mm upstream compared to measurements at 0.8 equivalence ratio. In Figure \ref{fig:SI_536_516_pos_mwt_fitting}B, we calculate the ratio of $\tau_{exp}$ at the respective SFR-maximized positions for the two equivalence ratios. In Figure \ref{fig:SI_tau_ratio_cfd_pos}, we calculate the ratio of $\tau_{pred}$ of the CFD data between the two equivalence ratios, but with the 0.6 equivalence ratio data shifted 25 mm downstream. The ratio of $\tau_{pred}$ is similar for both K+ and $O_2$ and is consistent with the experimental measurements.

The fit range is from 3 to 15 microseconds, which is not the same as in the main text but was chosen in this case to provide reasonable fits for all positions. The numbers on the right-hand side of each plot indicate the stage position in mm; (B): Signal to fluctuation ratio (SFR, see Eq.\ 9 in the main text) vs. stage position; (C) $\tau_{exp}$ vs. stage position.

\subsection{ICCD Camera Measurements}

This section contains additional measurements by the ICCD camera. 

The ICCD camera is calibrated using a projective transformation. The calibration image is shown in Figure \ref{fig:SI_iccd_calibration}. The calibration is performed by taking a picture of a ruler held at the exit of the HVOF barrel. The parameters for the projective transformation are determined by comparing the length of the ruler at the exit of the barrel and at 7 inches. From the transformed image, the pixel to mm conversion calibration is determined, and applied to calibrate the images.

\subsection{Laser Power Dependence}

We define an effective oxygen bimolecular recombination rate, $k_{r,b,eff}$, measured from the experiment. This requires that we assume O2 attachment is the dominant recombination pathway during the exponential regime of the MWT decay. We define $k_{r,b,eff}$ as 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:krbeff}
    k_{r,b,eff} = \frac{1}{\tau_{experiment} *  n_{O2}},
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{experiment}$ is the measured exponential time constant,  and $n_{O2}$ is the oxygen number density predicted from CFD. Additionally, if we assume that the collisional recombination partner of this effective reaction is the entire gas mixture, we can calculate the effective thermomolecular recombination coefficient as


\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:krteff}
    k_{r,t,eff} = \frac{1}{\tau_{experiment} * n_{all} *  n_{O2}},
\end{equation}
where $n_{all}$ is the total number density predicted from CFD. Figure \ref{fig:SI_krb_eff_53x} shows the calculation of $k_{r,t,eff}$ for 53x.
