- [] improve main pimax image

- [] try fitting mws to a profile with O2 tau and K+ bimolecular combo
- [] double check new O2 kinetics
    - [] implement unit handling noneq
    - [] implement other species

- [] add phi=0.6 and KOH data to mws position plot. 

- [] lifetime comparison of 536 and 516. Need to compare across positions. Relevant location for 516 may be inward.
