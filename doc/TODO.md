# TODO list 

# Figures 

Fig 1 
    - [] torch cross section with CD nozzle 
    - [] make jet flare
    - [] dimensions on schematic (jet size and goldilocks)
    - [] flip C, crop the top a bit. 

Fig 2

 - [x] CFD camera compare  and lifetime measurement
 - [] heat balance 

Fig 3 - 
    Comparison to CFD nK
    - [x] add absorption measurement and fit

Figure 4
- [x] 2 positions 
- [x] remove C and PD


Figure 5 
- [] fix colors for position confusion
- [x] ionization process (only and B)

Figrue 6
recombination process 

- [x] add delta ne0


# Immediate

- [] noneq_modeling
    - [] implement unit handling noneq

    - [] double check new O2 kinetics
        - [x] implement other species


- [] get tau and ne_0 for nominal case. Calcaulate eta_experiment. Add to discussion

- [] fix CFD barrel. Think it has to do with spike. Check beam position. 

- [] move diagnostics to SI?

- [] collect diagnostic information
 - [] oscilliscope settings time information
  - [] try taking off coarsening

- [] add standard plots for all three sequences to SI
    - [] fit parameters (nK, tau, ne_0)
    - [] raw
