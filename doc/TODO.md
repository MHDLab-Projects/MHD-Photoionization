# TODO list 

# Immediate

- [] respond comments
- [] move diagnostics to SI
- [] update noneq in SI
- [] run through writing
- [] add summary of KOH model (email)

# Medium

- [] implement numerical integration nK determination to final pipeline
- [] improve main pimax image
    - [] calibration
    - [] compare width to cfd beam profile

- [x] try fitting mws to a profile with O2 tau and K+ bimolecular combo
    - [] try refactoring dnedt models
    - [] calculate absorbed density with CFD KOH data to compare with dne. quantum yield?
- [] double check new O2 kinetics
    - [] implement unit handling noneq
    - [] implement other species

- [] add phi=0.6 and KOH data to mws position plot. 

- [] lifetime comparison of 536 and 516. Need to compare across positions. Relevant location for 516 may be inward. 


# Long

- [] investigate why phi coordinate value is 0.65.
