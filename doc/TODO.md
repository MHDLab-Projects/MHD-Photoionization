# TODO list 

## 2024-02-16

- [x] Refactor kinetics and update viability modeling to use oxygen 
- [] Add links to SI figures in discussion
- [x] analyze position dependence of kwt = 0.1 and phi 0.6 and compare to CFD
- [x] convert final folder to create dataset then generate figures. add more data.  

- [] add phi=0.6 and KOH data to mws position plot. 
- [] investigate why phi coordinate value is 0.65. 
- [] implement numerical integration nK determination to final pipeline


- [x] add 516 pos to SI
- [x] add PIMAX to SI
- [] lifetime comparison of 536 and 516. Need to compare across positions. Relevant location for 516 may be inward.
