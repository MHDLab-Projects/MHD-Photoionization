\subsection{Overview}

In this study, we preform an assessment of the viability of photoionization as a method of enhancing the performance of MHD generators. We use a combination of experimental and modeling techniques to determine the feasibility of the concept.


viability via excitation of bulk flow (usual MHD temps or extend MHD to lower temps) or target boundary layer to reduce voltage drop (channel loss mechanism)
