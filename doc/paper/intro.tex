\subsection{Overview}

In this study, we preform an assessment of the viability of photoionization as a method of enhancing the performance of MHD generators. We use a combination of experimental and modeling techniques to determine the feasibility of the concept. 

In the assessment of viability we consider excitation of the bulk flow and targeting cold boundary layers. Excitation of the bulk flow could extend MHD operation to lower temperatures, while targeting the boundary layer could reduce the voltage drop across the boundary layer which is a significant loss mechanism in MHD generators.
