\subsection{Experiment and Modeling Overview}

To study the photoionization process we performed experiments with a modified Praxair JP-8200 high-velocity oxy fuel (HVOF) system as shown in Figure \ref{fig:expt_setup}. We have previously reported experiments with this system and a MHD generator attachment [AIAA 2020]. In the experiment presented here, the HVOF torch is used without the generator attachment so that the free jet can be studied.  The HVOF is powered with K1 kerosene combusted with >99\% pure oxygen and the volumetric flows of the HVOF process inputs are monitored independently with NIST traceable devices as described in Zeuthen et al.[1] Potassium is introduced to the flame with a custom-built liquid seeding system. The liquid-seeding system utilizes a Harvard Apparatus PHD Ultra(tm) Syringe pump to inject a potassium emulsion into the fuel line before the combustor. The potassium emulsion preparation and composition is described in the SI. The flow of the emulsion is set to achieve a nominal weight percentage of potassium atoms (K wt\%) in the flame. The JP-8200 fuel flow and oxygen flows are set to maintain a target total mass flow of 13 g/s, which is used throughout the experiments presented in this report.

We utilize a Gam KrF Excimer laser to photoionize the potassium seeded combustion products. The excimer laser outputs a 248 nm pulse with a duration of approximately 10 ns. The laser power is varied with a Thorlabs filter wheel and UV enhanced reflective neutral density filters. The laser is directed into the free jet where a variety of custom-built diagnostics measure the response. These diagnostics are discussed in more detail below and in the supporting information, but outlined here. The diagnostics include a time-resolved microwave scattering (MWS) system, two absorption emission spectroscopy (AES) systems, a photodiode (PD), and a PI-MAX4 ICCD Camera.  The MWS diagnostic, a second AES diagnostic (AES2), and PD are located on motorized stage and probe the free jet at various locations downstream from the barrel exit. The PD (Figure \ref*{fig:SI_PD_setup_schematic})  isolates the potassium D line with a bandpass filter (770 $\pm$ 10 nm) to a Thorlabs photodiode to measure the fluctuation of the optical emission with time resolution.  Finally, a PI-MAX4 ICCD Camera is positioned above the entire system at a fixed position to capture time-resolved images of the free jet. The ICCD camera has a 775 +- 25 nm bandpass filter to isolate the potassium D line. The MWS diagnostic measures the change in microwave transmission through the free jet in response to a laser pulse, which is related to relative changes in the free electron population. The AES diagnostic measures the absorption of a 780 nm LED through the free jet, which is related to the potassium number density. There is an AES system at the exit of the HVOF barrel (AES1), which probes the potassium density at the start of the free jet.

In addition to experimental measurements we performed CFD simulations of the free jet to compare with the experimental data. The CFD simulations are performed with OpenFOAM and are described in more detail in the SI. \ref{fig:ICCD_CFD}A-C show key results from the CFD simulations. Images taken from the PI-MAX4 ICCD camera are also shown in Figure \ref{fig:ICCD_CFD}D-E, where the laser can be observed to cause photoluminescence in the free jet. Figure \ref{fig:ICCD_CFD}F shows the time decay of the photoluminescence in the free jet along with the laser pulse profile measured by sending the laser directly into the ICCD camera. The laser pulse profile was measured in 2018 and it is possible that the laser pulse profile has changed since then.

This photoluminescence arises from the well-known phenomenon of laser-induced fluoresce in Alkali compounds (hydroxides, chlorides, etc.) which has been used to measure the species concentration of these alkali compounds in flames.[Oldenbork 1986] The excited states of the alkali compounds are weakly bound and dissociate. For KOH, there is a UV absorption band with a peak near the 248 nm wavelength of our laser, and the dissociated state creates a K atom in the excited 2P0 state [Oldenbork and Leffler 2017]. This excited K atom is known to rapidly photo luminesce. The radiative lifetime of an isolated 2P0 state K atom is about 25 ns, but this lifetime will be reduced by collisional quenching, consistent with our measurements. [leffler 2017, (Smirinov (Fund. Of Ionized Gases - Table 2.8)]. This means that the photoluminescence decay is not able to give insight into the recombination kinetics of the free electrons, which is needed to determine the feasibility of the photoionization process.



To probe the free electron density directly, we developed a custom-built microwave scattering (MWS) diagnostic to directly probe changes in the free electron population and measure the electron-ion recombination rate. Similar diagnostic tools have been developed in the literature.[]  We describe the system and data analysis pipeline in more detail in the supporting information. Briefly, 90 GHz microwaves are transmitted through the seeded HVOF torch and the transmitted power is measured with a IQ mixer. The system measures the change in the transmitted microwave power when a UV pulse passes through the center of the horns.  The IQ mixer combines the collected signal with the original microwave signal to measure the in phase (I) and quadrature (Q), or 90 degrees out of phase, components of the transmitted microwave power. Utilizing an IQ mixer allows us to enhance the sensitivity of the measurement by isolating the frequency of the microwave source, and to isolate changes in transmitted power from phase shifts. The magnitude, $U [V]$ of the transmitted microwaves is calculated through.

\begin{equation}
    U(t) = \sqrt{I(t)^2 + Q(t)^2}
\end{equation}

We define the normalized transmission, ($T(t)$), by normalizing by the measured $U$ in the absence of a free jet taken before or after the experiment, $U_{nothing}$. 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:transmission_def}
    T(t) = \frac{U(t)}{U_{nothing}}
\end{equation}

We do not attempt to distinguish between absorbed and scattered microwaves and define a quantity, $AS(t) = 1- T(t)$, which is the combined absorption and scattering. We are interested in the change in $AS(t)$ in response to the laser pulse, $\Delta AS(t)$. In terms of the transmission, $\Delta AS(t)$ is given by

\begin{equation}
    \Delta AS(t) = AS(t) - AS_{PP} =  T_{PP} - T(t)
\end{equation}

Where $T_{PP}$ is the average transmission in a 1-2 $\mu s$ time window before the laser pulse ($AS_{PP} = 1 - T_{PP}$). This processing of the MWS signal with an example date, measurements of $U_{nothing}$, and measurements with a Silicon test sample, are shown in the SI. The fitting of the MWS signal is described in the results section. 


The absorption emission spectroscopy (AES) is used to determine the potassium number density, $n_K$. The AES system measures the transmission of a LED generated light through the free jet, while also taking into account that the free jet is thermally emitting light of the same wavelengths. The LED generates light with a spectrum centered around 780 nm with an approximately 50 nm bandwidth that includes the 767 and 770 nm potassium peaks. The light is passed through the free jet and measured with a high-resolution spectrometer. Two separate AES setups are applied to the exit of the barrel and at the center of the microwave horns (see Figure \ref{fig:expt_setup}).

The spectrally dependent absorption, $\alpha(\lambda)$, is measured from the intensity of the LED with no free jet, $I_{calib}$, the intensity of the seeded jet by itself, $I_F$ , and the intensity of the seeded free jet and LED together $I_{L+F}$

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:absorption_def}
    \alpha(\lambda) = 1 - \left(\frac{I_{L+F}(\lambda) - I_{F}(\lambda)}{I_{calib}(\lambda)}\right)
\end{equation}


To determine $\alpha(\lambda)$, we have developed a numerical integration algorithm to account for the spatial variation in the free jet. The algorithm uses the normalized CFD profile of the potassium density along the path of the LED beam. The normalized CFD profile is converted to a $n_K$ profile with the single fit parameter, the centerline (maximum) $n_{K, cl}$. For each wavelength, we calculate the absorption coefficient and numerically integrate the Beer-Lambert law along the beam path with the Euler method to predict $\alpha(\lambda)$. The fit parameter $n_{K,cl}$ is then determined through a least squares optimization of the predicted and measured $\alpha(\lambda)$ across the entire spectrum.  The AES system, data processing pipeline, and data fitting pipeline are described in more detail in the supporting information. 

\subsection{Experiment Procedures}

Experiments consist of a variety of 'test cases', where the the system is brought to a specific combination of independent variables and measurements are performed.   For the HVOF process, the equivalence ratio and potassium mass fraction are the primary independent variables. The position of the motorized stage and power of the excimer laser are also varied.  The syringe pump based feeding method has the disadvantage of a finite amount of emulsion that can be fed into the torch before needing to reload the syringe.  Therefore, experimental results are performed in 'sequences' of test cases, where one or more of these independent variables is changed. The syringe pump limits the duration of a given test case sequence, with shorter durations at high potassium mass fraction. Furthermore, it was not possible to maintain consistent durations for the same test cases performed in different sequences. In the main text, we focus on two test case sequences performed at full laser power:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Stage Position Dependence: Varying the stage position at a fixed potassium mass fraction of 1\%. This sequence was performed on each experiment date (twice on 2023-05-18) with an equivalence ratio of 0.8 except for 2023-05-24, where the equivalence ratio was 0.6.
    \item Potassium Mass Fraction Dependence: Varying the potassium mass fraction at a fixed stage position of 180 mm downstream of the barrel exit and equivalence ratio of 0.8. Performed on each experiment date.
\end{itemize}

The motivation for the form of these test case sequences is discussed in the results section. In particular, the fixed stage position of 180 mm downstream of the barrel exit (shown in Figures \ref{fig:expt_setup} and \ref{fig:ICCD_CFD}) is chosen to maximize the effectiveness of the MWS diagnostic. A variety of other test case sequences were performed and are discussed in the supporting information, along with further information on the primary test case sequences performed here. 

The results in this paper derive from an experimental campaign that was conducted over 4 dates: 2023-04-07, 2023-05-12, 2023-05-18, and 2023-05-24. Throughout the campaign the above test case sequences were repeated to ensure reproducibility of the results.  On some dates, the same test case sequence was repeated within a date, so we define a 'Run' as a unique instance of a test case sequence labeled by the date and an integer ("run number").  Unless otherwise noted, error bars in the results represent the standard deviation across Runs. On later experiment dates, additional diagnostic measurements were added. 2023-05-12: ICCD and AES2. 2023-05-24: PD.

For each diagnostic, data is obtained continuously throughout the experiment and indexed in time. For each individual test case, there are a number of repeated acquisitions depending on the duration of the test case and acquisition rate of the diagnostic. In the data processing, these repeated acquisitions are averaged to obtain a single value for each test case before further analysis (e.g. fitting). For statistics across runs, the variation within repeat acquisitions is not considered. Importantly, the position dependent nK measurement was taken by multiplexing both AES diagnostics to the same spectrometer, meaning only one AES measurement could be taken at a time. Throughout the measurement the multiplexer switched continuously between the two AES diagnostics, so the measurements at the two AES locations are not simultaneous. 

The time limitation on seeding duration limits the AES diagnostic more than the MWS diagnostic. The AES diagnostic must wait 1 second between LED switching events to allow for the LED to stabilize. Additionally, the multiplexer switches every 10s. Therefore a minimum of at least 20 s is needed for a nK measurement at both location, but ideally multiple measurements are taken at each location to ensure reproducibility. The MWS diagnostic, on the other hand, is continuously acquiring at the repetition rate of the laser (10 Hz TODO check this). Therefore for a given test case sequences, the MWS diagnostic has more data than the AES diagnostic. For the standard test case sequences outlined above, approximately 1 minute was used for each test case and data is presented for both diagnostics.  

Another limitation of the AES diagnostic is that it must be calibrated to the spectral LED intensity without any absorbing medium. It is not possible to stop HVOF system to perform a AES calibration without risking the system not being able to restart. Therefore, measurements of the AES calibration can only be performed at the beginning and end of a given experiment. We interpolate this calibration throughout the time of the experiment to help reduce the influence of calibration drift, but it is not always possible to eliminate this effect which shows as an offset in the off-peak absorption coefficient.
