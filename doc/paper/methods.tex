\subsection{Experimental}

Figure \ref{fig:expt_setup} shows the experimenal setup. 

HVOF torch with syringe pump potassium feeding. 

Throughout the experiment, the HVOF process is monitored with a variety of diagnostics.

A sample experiment is shown in Figure \ref{fig:expt_example}.

There are a variety of independent variables that have been controlled through out the experiments to explore the photoionization process. For the HVOF process, the total mass flow, equivalence ratio, and atomic potassium mass fraction are controlled. Additionally, the position of the mobile MWS and AES diagnositics are controlled, as welw as the excimer laser power. 

Experiments consist of a variety of 'test cases', where the the system is brought to a specific combination of the independent variables and measurements are performed. In particular, 'sequences' of test cases are performed where one of these independent variables is changed. 

For the results presented in this report, the equivalence ratio is held constant at a value of 0.8, the total mass flow rate is held constant at 13 g/s. These variables have been varied in supplementary test case sequences, with data shown in the SI. In this report, we focus on three sequences where the potassium mass fraction, the laser power, and the position of the laser downstream from the exit of the free jet are varied. Notably, when not being varied, the position of the AES/MWS diagnotsics is held fixed downstream of the torch at a 'nominal position' of 178 mm. The motivation for this position is discussed in the results section. 

Test case sequences (TODO: improve names)
\begin{itemize}
    \item 536 Position: Varying MWS/AES diagnsotic position. Full laser power. Kwt = 1\%
    \item 536 Power: Varying laser power. MWS/AES diagnostic at nominal position. Kwt = 1\%
    \item 53x: Varying potassium mass fraction. MWS/AES diagnostic at nominal position. Full laser power.
\end{itemize}



We note that the syringe pump based feeding method has the disadvantage of a finite amount of emulsion that can be fed into the torch. This limits the duration of a given test case sequence, with shorter durations at high potassium mass fraction. For this reason, it was note possible to maintain consistent durations for the different test case sequences.


Diagnostic proccessing is shown in Figure \ref{fig:diagnostic_processing}.

\subsubsection{Microwave scattering}

 In previous experiments we have determined that the optical emission lifetime is on the order of 10 nanoseconds (SI), which is much shorter than what is predicted for electrion-ion recombination. This fast optical decay is consistent with a chemilumiesence process associated with laser-induced dissocation of KOH. [] 

To probe the free electron density, we developed a MWS diagonstic to probe the free electron density and measure the electron-ion recombination rate. Similar diagnostic tools have been developed in the literature.[] The instrument uses a 90 Ghz Gunn microwave source, IQ mixer, etc. The propogation of the radiation through space is not well characterized, so the system measures relative changes instead of absolute transmission. The system measures the change in the trasmitted microwave power when a UV pulse passes through the center of the horns. The UV pulse is created with a GAM Excimer laser with 10ns pulse. 

The measurements and processing of the system are shown in Figure \ref{fig:diagnostic_processing}. The IQ mixer is connected to a Lecroy oscilliscope and the in phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signals are recorded with each laser pulse as shown in Figure \ref{fig:diagnostic_processing}A. The magnitude of the tranmitted microwaves is shown in \ref{fig:diagnostic_processing}B and is calculated with the following equation.

\begin{equation}
    Mag(t) = \sqrt{I(t)^2 + Q(t)^2}
\end{equation}

The signal is then converted to a transmission by 

\begin{equation}
    T(t) = \frac{Mag(t)}{Mag_{Pre Pulse}}
\end{equation}

Where $Mag_{Pre Pulse}$ is the average magnitude within a time window of one microsecond before the laser pulse. 

Finally, we calculate the combined absorption and scattering, AS, by

\begin{equation}
    AS(t) = 1 - T(t)
\end{equation}

We fit the AS data with a kinetic model. 

\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\Delta n_e}{dt} = - k_r [2 n_{K+,0}\Delta n_e + \Delta{n_e}^2]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Absorption spectroscopy}

The absorption emission spectroscopy is used to determine the potassium number density, $n_K$. the AES system uses a 780 nm LED source and a high resolution HR4000 spectrometer. $n_K$ is determined at the exit of the barrel and at the center of the microwave horns (see Figure \ref{fig:expt_setup}).

TODO: how much should this be copied from AIAA 2020

The spectrally dependent absorption, $\alpha(\lambda)$, is measured from the intensity of the LED with no free jet, $I_0$, the intensity
of the seeded jet by itself, $I_F$ , and the intensity of the seeded free jet and LED together $I_{L+F}$


\begin{equation}
    \alpha(\lambda) = 1 - \left(\frac{I_{L+F}(\lambda) - I_{F}(\lambda)}{I_F(\lambda)}\right)
\end{equation}

Currently the absorption is fit with the Beer-Lambert law, but we are working on numerical integration of the absorption to determine the number density and this section will be rewritten. 

The differential equaiton is 

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dI}{dx} = -\kappa(\lambda) n_K(x) I
\end{equation}

If we assume $n_K$ is constant, we can solve the differential equation to get the Beer lambert law:

\begin{equation}
    \alpha(\lambda) = 1 - \exp(-\kappa(\lambda) n_K L)
\end{equation}

Where $L$ is the path length.

For numerical integration, we write $n_K(x) = n_{K,max} f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is the profile of the number density along the beam path determined by CFD.
