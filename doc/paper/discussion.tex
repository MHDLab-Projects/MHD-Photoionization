* Evidence of KOH -> e-
    * K dependence: 
    * AS maximum varies with n_(K,barrel) while n_(K,goldilocks)  is constant. 
* Position dependence: 
    * AS peak is downstream, not exit of barrel
    * TODO: compare to photodiode
    * Previous evidence that optical emission is KOH and peaks at similar location
    * Not same test conditionsâ€¦Add old results to SI
* Kr is similar to historical results. Electron recombination proceeds normally
