\section{Discussion}

\begin{markdown}
* Evidence of KOH -> e-
    * K dependence: 
    * AS maximum varies with n_(K,barrel) while n_(K,goldilocks)  is constant. 
* Position dependence: 
    * AS peak is downstream, not exit of barrel
    * TODO: compare to photodiode
    * Previous evidence that optical emission is KOH and peaks at similar location
    * Not same test conditionsâ€¦Add old results to SI
* Kr is similar to historical results. Electron recombination proceeds normally

\subsection{Position dependence}

The temperature at the exit of the torch is sufficiently high for thermally induced conductivity. Variations in the flow or potassium distribution could cause these time dependent fluctuations. We provide some analysis of these background fluctuations in the SI (TODO).
