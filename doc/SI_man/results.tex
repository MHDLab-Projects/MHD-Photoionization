\subsection{Equivalence Ratio Dependence}

On 2023-05-24, we performed measurements with equivalence ratio varying from the standard value of 0.8. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item 516 - a position sweep at fixed equivalence ratio 0.6
    \item 5x3\_pos - a position and equivalence ratio sweep at 5 equivalence ratios and 0.1\% potassium mass fraction. The lower potassium mass fraction allowed for longer times on each test case and therefore AES nK measurements. 
    \item 5x6\_pos - a position and equivalence ratio sweep at 5 equivalence ratios and 1\% potassium mass fraction. The high potassium mass fraction meant short times on each test case with only enough time for MWS measurements. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{5x3 and 5x6 Position Dependence Test Case Sequences}

This section contains additional measurements for the 5x3 and 5x6 test case sequences. These were 'two dimensional' parameter sweeps of both stage position and equivalence ratio. See Figure \ref{fig:SI_expt_overview_2023-05-24} for how the sequence was performed. 

Figure \ref{fig:SI_5x3_pos_nK_m3} shows the AES measurements for the 5x3\_pos test case. Note the calibration of the AES signal for this test case exhibited significant calibration drift (see \ref{fig:SI_5x3_pos_alpha}), and systematic error may be present in the nK values.

\subsubsection{516 Position Dependence Test Case Sequence}

This section contains additional measurements for the 516 test case. This test case was a position sweep at fixed nominal equivalence ratio 0.6. The higher seed rate and longer time on each test case allows for more accurate determination of AS exponential time constants than 5x3\_pos and 5x6\_pos test case sequences. We we also able to perform AES measurements which are presented in the main text.

\subsection{ICCD Camera Measurements}

This section contains additional measurements by the ICCD camera. 

The ICCD camera is calibrated using a projective transformation. The calibration image is shown in Figure \ref{fig:SI_iccd_calibration}. The calibration is performed by taking a picture of a ruler held at the exit of the HVOF barrel. The parameters for the projective transformation are determined by comparing the length of the ruler at the exit of the barrel and at 7 inches. From the transformed image, the pixel to mm conversion calibration is determined, and applied to calibrate the images.

\subsection{Laser power dependence}

Figure \ref{fig:SI_power_dependence_AS} shows the MWS signal as a function of the laser power. We observe that the AS signal increases super-linearly with the laser power. The $\Delta AS_{max}$ as a function of laser fluence is fit to a power law of the form $\Delta AS_{max} = A * P^k$. The fit parameters are shown in Figure \ref{fig:SI_power_dependence_AS}C.

For high laser powers, the AS decay exhibits a steeper slope within the first few $\mu s$ after the laser pulse, indicating second-order effects. The exponential exponential time constant of each power is similar, indicating a relatively power-independent first-order recombination process (SI).

We define an effective oxygen bimolecular recombination rate, $k_r{r, b,eff}$ Measured from experiment. This requires that we assume O2 attachment is the dominant recombination pathway during the exponential regime of the MWS decay. We define $k_{r,b,eff}$ as 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:krbeff}
    k_{r,b,eff} = \frac{1}{\tau_{experiment} *  n_{O2}}
\end{equation}

where $\tau_{experiment}$ is the measured exponential time constant,  and $n_{O2}$ is the oxygen number density predicted from CFD. Additionally, if we assume that the collisional recombination partner of this effective reaction is the entire gas mixture, we can calculate the effective termolecular recombination coefficient as


\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:krteff}
    k_{r,t,eff} = \frac{1}{\tau_{experiment} * n_{all} *  n_{O2}}
\end{equation}

Where $n_{all}$ is the total number density predicted from CFD.

Figure \ref{fig:SI_krb_eff_53x} shows the calculation of the effective recombination coefficients for 53x.

\subsubsection{Differential equation fitting method }

We explored an alternative fitting method for the $\Delta AS$ time profiles by directly solving numerically the differential equation \ref{eq:full_deqn_phi} with $G_{NE} =0$. This method should in principle account for the bimolecular recombination term in equation \ref{eq:full_deqn_phi}. For simplicty and robust results, we limit ourselves to exponential fitting in the main text, but this numerical fitting procedure should be explored futher. 

Fitting is performed with the lmfit package in Python. For the solution to the differential equation we assume a $k_{r,b,K+} = 1 \times 10^{-8} cm^3/s$ . The differential equation is solved with the scipy solve\_ivp function. The solution and the $\Delta AS$ curve are both normalized and normalized solution is fit to the normalized $\Delta AS$ curve with the lmfit package. Figure \ref{fig:SI_Kwt_Recombination_fitmethod_compare} shows a comparison between exponential fitting and full differential equation fitting for the recombination coefficient.
