\subsection{Equivalence Ratio Dependence}

On 2023-05-24, we performed measurements with equivalence ratio varying from the standard value of 0.8. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item 516 - a position sweep at fixed equivalence ratio 0.6
    \item 5x3\_pos - a position and equivalence ratio sweep at 5 equivalence ratios and 0.1\% potassium mass fraction. The lower potassium mass fraction allowed for longer times on each test case and therefore AES nK measurements. 
    \item 5x6\_pos - a position and equivalence ratio sweep at 5 equivalence ratios and 1\% potassium mass fraction. The high potassium mass fraction meant short times on each test case with only enough time for MWS measurements. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{5x3 and 5x6 Position Dependence Test Case Sequences}

This section contains additional measurements for the 5x3 and 5x6 test case sequences. These were 'two dimensional' parameter sweeps of both stage position and equivalence ratio. See Figure \ref{fig:SI_expt_overview_2023-05-24} for how the sequence was performed. 

Figure \ref{fig:SI_5x3_pos_nK_m3} shows the AES measurements for the 5x3\_pos test case. Note the calibration of the AES signal for this test case exhibited significant calibration drift (see \ref{fig:SI_5x3_pos_alpha}), and systematic error may be present in the nK values.

\subsubsection{516 Position Dependence Test Case Sequence}

This section contains additional measurements for the 516 test case. This test case was a position sweep at fixed nominal equivalence ratio 0.6. The higher seed rate and longer time on each test case allows for more accurate determination of AS decay times than 5x3\_pos and 5x6\_pos test case sequences. We could also perform AES measurements which are presented in the main text. 

TODO: this maybe should be in the main text.

\subsection{ICCD Camera Measurements}

This section contains additional measurements by the ICCD camera. Figure \ref{fig:SI_536_iccd} shows ICCD data taken at the 536 test case at the nominal position of 178 mm. Figure \ref{fig:SI_536_iccd}C shows that the photolumensence decay is very short compared the the mws decay. In previous experiments, we have investigated the time resolved spectral decay of the photolumensence and observed that it is entirely due to the decay of the potassium D1 line (TODO: check), and the 10ns decay profile closely matches the time profile of the laser pulse. 

The ICCD camera is calibrated using a projective transformation. The calibration image is shown in Figure \ref{fig:SI_iccd_calibration}. The calibration is performed by taking a picture of a ruler held at the exit of the HVOF barrel. The parameters for the projective transformation are determined by comparing the length of the ruler at the exit of the barrel and at 7 inches. From the transformed image, the pixel to mm conversion calibration is determined, and applied to calibrate the images.

\subsection{Laser power dependence}

Figure \ref{fig:SI_power_dependence} shows the MWS signal as a function of the laser power. We observe that the AS signal increases super-linearly with the laser power. For high laser powers, the AS decay exhibits a steeper slope within the first few $\mu s$ after the laser pulse, indicating second-order effects. The exponential decay time constant of each power is similar, indicating a relatively power-independent first-order recombination process (SI).
